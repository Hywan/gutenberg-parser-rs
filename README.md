## The Gutenberg post parser.

[Gutenberg] is a new post editor for the [WordPress] ecosystem. A post
has always been HTML, and it continues to be. The difference is that
the HTML is annotated. Like most annotation language, it is located in
comments, like this:

```html
<h1>Famous post</h1>

<!-- wp:component {attributes: "as JSON"} -->
lorem ipsum
<!-- /wp:component -->
```

The parser analyses a post and generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of it.

### Platforms and bindings

The parser aims at being used on different platforms, such as: Web
within multiple browsers, Web applications like [Electron], native
applications like macOS, iOS, Windows, Linux etc.

Thus, the parser can be compiled as a static library, can be embedded
in any Rust projects, can be compiled to [WebAssembly], and soon more.

This project uses [Justfile] as an alternative to Makefile. Every
following command will use `just`, you might consider to install
it. To learn about all the commands, just `just --list`.

#### Static library

To compile the parser to a static library, run:

```sh
$ just build-library
$ ls target/release/
```

#### WebAssembly

To compile the parser to a [WebAssembly] file, run:

```sh
$ just build-wasm
$ open bindings/wasm/index.html # for a demonstration
```

### Performance and guarantee

The parser guarantees to never copy the data in memory, which makes it
fast and memory efficient.
